Prove: map f (map g l) = map g (map f l)
Know:  f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) for all numbers
Base Case: x = [], x is an empty list
By how map is defined, we know that:
    map g x = [] 
and 
    map f x = []
so:
    map f (map g x) = map f ([]) = []
and
    map g (map f x) = map g ([]) = []
Thus:
    map f (map g x) = map g (map f x)

Inductive hypothesis:
    map f (map g n) = map g (map f n), where n is a list of arbitrary size

Prove:
    map f (map g m) = map g (map f m), where m is a list of size(n) + 1

Proof:
    map f (map g m) = map f (map g m:n), where m:n is the first element of m, followed by the other n elements
    map f (map g m:n) = f(g(m)) ++ map f (map g n), by definition of map
    f(g(m)) ++ map f (map g n) = g(f(m)) ++ map f (map g n), by the Know condition
    g(f(m)) ++ map f (map g n) = g(f(m)) ++ map g (map f n), by Inductive hypothesis
    g(f(m)) ++ map g (map f n) = map g (map f m:n), by definition of concatenation, and map
Thus:
    map f (map g m) = map f (map g m)
